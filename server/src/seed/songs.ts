C                                                Am
I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told
            G
I have squandered my resistance
      G7           G6               C
For a pocketful of mumbles such are promises
              Am          G                 F
All lies and jest still a man hears what he wants to hear
                    C  *riff*  G   C
And disregards the rest
                                                    Am
When I left my home and family I was no more than a boy
        G
In the company of strangers
        G7         G6              C
In the quiet of a railway station running scared
        Am           G             F                                C
Laying low seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go
          G             F               C
Looking for the places only they would know

        Am

Lie-la-lie la lie-la-lie
        Am

C                                                Am
Asking only workmans wages I come looking for a job
              G
But I get no offers
        G7              G6                C
Just a come-on from the whores on seventh avenue
        Am              G                F                               C
I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome I took some comfort there

        G               C
Ooo-la-la la la la la


Ref.

C
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
                  Am
And wishing I was gone
      G              G7            G6             C
Going home where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Em           Am
Leading me
        G
Going Home

        C                                            Am
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
          G
And he carries the reminders
    G7               G6              C
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down or cut him 'till he cried out
                        Am
In his anger and his shame
        G              F                              C
"I am Leaving, I am Leaving."  But the Fighter still remains
